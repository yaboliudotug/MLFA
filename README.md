## ü§û Acknowledgements 
We mainly appreciate for these good projects and their authors' hard-working.
- This work is based on [SIGMA](https://github.com/CityU-AIM-Group/SIGMA). 
- The implementation of our anchor-free detector is from [FCOS](https://github.com/tianzhi0549/FCOS/tree/f0a9731dac1346788cc30d5751177f2695caaa1f), which highly relies on [maskrcnn-benchmark](https://github.com/facebookresearch/maskrcnn-benchmark).
- The feature alignment is from [TTAC](https://github.com/Gorilla-Lab-SCUT/TTAC).
